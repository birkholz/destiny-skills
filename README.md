Skill calculators for Destiny

Live at http://birkholz.github.io/destiny-skills

Web-based subclass calculators created to emulate the subclass skill trees shown in early previews of Destiny. The released game ended up being a bit different, but it was fun to try and make the interface in JS/CSS. The primary purpose was to give people a way to see the subclass details in the same way they were shown in-game, as the only information available online at the time was videos and text. Since release, ZAM and others created calculators (such as [this](http://destinydb.com/items/2455559914/striker)) that represented the final versions.

* One subclass per class, this was all that was available in early previews prior to the beta
* Properly supports the double jump, melee, and super columns
* Sharable builds via unique URLs
